# Peter Landbris - Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! I am a web developer based in GÃ¶teborg, Sweden. Below are some of the projects I have worked on:

## Adoranten
Co-developer (mainly frontend) of a website for a journal using Vue.js and Wagtail CMS. The project focuses on creating a modern and user-friendly platform both for the journal admins to publish articles through the CMS and for the users reading the articles.

## Svenska Elsparkcyklar AB
A team project developed during a course at BTH, focusing on distributed teamwork and full-stack development of an E-scooter rental system for customers and admins. I was mainly responsible for the backend. The project includes a REST API (NestJS), React-based frontend with TypeScript, and a Svelte bike simulator.

## Collaborative Document Editor
A real-time collaborative document editor (similar to Google Docs) developed during a team project course at BTH. Main focus was functionality rather than design. It is hosted on Azure with features like authentication, WebSocket-based live editing, and a code editor mode using CodeMirror. Built with React and TypeScript frontend and Express.js backend.
